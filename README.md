## Acknowledgements

This project is inspired by the [Particle Life project by @hunar4321](https://github.com/hunar4321/particle-life).

Some aspects of the physics simulation were refined using ideas and example code from that project. The final implementation was assisted by GitHub Copilot and may contain similarities in parameter values or behavior, but uses a different approach and was written independently in C.
